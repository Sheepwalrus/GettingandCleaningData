## Getting and Cleaning Data Project
The purpose of this project is to, bluntly stated, get and clean data. In this instance, it's meant to take a known large data set and tidy it up such that it can be useable. 

This is accomplished through working with the data set located at the following link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
